# DESCRIPTION
This tool helps manage a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. 

## Project Repo & Demo
The [code for this employee tracker](https://github.com/melissakinsey/employee-schema) is housed on GitHub.  
		
## User Story
*AS A* business owner *I WANT TO* view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company *SO I CAN* organize and plan my business.	
	
## Usage
To use this app, type 'node index.js' on the command line. Then choose the number of the task you'd like to accomplish. To add a role, for example, select "2" on your keyboard. To see how the tracker works, watch this quick [video demo](https://youtu.be/4snwFDtDfyQ).
	
# FEATURES
This app makes it easy for nondevelopers to view and interact with content management systems (CMSs) and other databases. Users can access data—including names, id numbers, titles, and salaries—by employee, department, or role.

# TECHNICAL SPECS
* Runs on the command line. 
* Uses mySQL to store database records. 
* Uses npm inquirer to interact with users. 
* Formats data with npm console.table. 
	
# LESSONS LEARNED 
Working with SQL databases, schema, and tables helped me better nderstand the conceptual models used in entity relationship diagrams. Although I ended up scrapping it, I started out using a seed database containing 300,000 employee records. I could see how powerful SQL might be in slicing and dicing real demographic data in various ways, depending on the use case.
